Bangkok serves as the capital of Thailand and stands as its largest metropolitan area. It garners significant global attention as a highly sought-after tourist destination. Alongside Chiang Mai and Phuket, Bangkok constitutes one of the three essential cities for any traveler exploring Thailand. Bangkok boasts an array of captivating tourist attractions, encompassing delectable local cuisine, fashionable shopping districts, temples, party streets with music playing all night, contemporary skyscrapers, and more. The city's distinct character is further enriched by its unique culture and amicable populace, setting it apart from others.

## 1﻿. Immerse yourself in Thai culinary delights
Thai cuisine is one of the greatest attractions to experience while in Thailand. It is here that you can discover the true flavor of the food, as well as taste new dishes that you won't necessarily be able to find in a restaurant outside of this country. Bangkok is saturated with restaurants offering dishes from all corners of Asia, but it is also worth trying national dishes such as Pad Kra Pao (Pork & Holy Basil Stir-fry), Chicken Khao Soi (Thai Coconut Curry Noodle Soup), Som Tam (Thai Green Papaya Salad), Kuay Teow Reua (Thai Boat Noodles) or Joke (Rice Poorage). Not counting the numerous streetfood stands and local markets.
Although Thailand is mostly known for its affordable food, we can also find something to tweak our taste buds at top-tier, Michelin-starred restaurants.

## 2﻿. See Chinatown district
[Chinatown](https://goo.gl/maps/PaYVMF8RcnqH8vZg6) one of the largest Chinatowns in the world. It was founded in 1782 when the city was established as the capital. In the afternoon, walking through its streets, we can enjoy the charms of this district. One thing to keep in mind - in the evening hours, it can be terribly crowded here. So it's worth taking with you the least amount of things that can irritate other tourists and allow you to move freely in the crowd. In Chinatown itself, we can expect to see long streets with vendors on display, food unique to this district and a street lit up with signs from everywhere. On the outskirts of the district, we can also find 2 temples that are close to [Chinatown Gate](https://goo.gl/maps/5Cv9bQDycWHC16mG7). For people who are more curious about exotic flavors, there are restaurants in the district that offer the rather controversial fin soup. Closer to weekends, there is a chance to encounter a parade passing through the streets.

## 3. Give a try to Shabu's and Korean BBQ's
In the world of culinary flavors, there can be no missing a word about Shabu, a style of eating so populous that often residents can arrange to go out to dinner twice a week as if not more often. What is it, though? Imagine a cauldron of broth placed on our table. Around it will be ingredients such as meat, vegetables, noodles or seafood. Having these things, simply from our liking we put them in the cauldron and cook them. The finished products we eat and share with friends. Interestingly, Shabu itself took its name from the sound of meat being dipped into the broth (shabu-shabu). Of course, this is not the only type of preparation of the dish, other variants include Mookata (a space in the center for frying meat, on the sides for soup), Korean Grill (an option for frying meat on a grate using coal or gas), or Hot Pot (a pot with broth, often exists in vetji divided in half, so we can have two broths in one pot, such as spicy and mushroom) and in some places we can get a stone grill, on which we can fry fish or prawns. Many of these places exist as all-you-can-eat buffets, giving us a time usually within 1.5h. The price usually ranges from 200-300 THB.
